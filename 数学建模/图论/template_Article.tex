$\{v,w\}$ is said to join the vertices v , w and is again abbreviated to $vw$. Example : $vv$ 

\begin{center}
    \colorbox{mygrey}{\color{myred}isomorphism}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item one-one correspondence between the vertices of $G_1$ and those of $G_2$ such that the number of edges joining any two vertices of $G_1$ equals the number of edges joining the corresponding vertices of $G_2$
        \item the \textbf{unlabelled graphs} and \textbf{labelled graphs} is different

    \begin{itemize}
        \item A graph is connected of it cannot be expressed as a union of graghs and disconnected otherwise.

    \colorbox{mygrey}{\color{myred}Adjacency and degrees（邻接）}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the $v,w$ is \textbf{adjacency} if there is an edge vw joining them. and $v,w$ are incident with such edge
        \item degree of a vetex is the number of edges incident with itself.
        \item A vetex of degree 0 is an isolated vertex 
        \item A vetex of degree 1 is an end vertex 
    \end{itemize}
\end{center}
The \textbf{degree sequence} of a graph consists of degrees written in \textbf{increasing order}

\begin{center}
    \colorbox{mygrey}{\color{myred}Handshaking lemma}\colorbox{mygrey}{In any graph the sum of all the vertex-degrees}
    \colorbox{mygrey}{is an even number.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}

    \colorbox{mygrey}{\color{myred}Subgraphs}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A graph is a \textbf{subgraph} of graph G if each of its vertices belongs to $V(G)$ and each of its edges belongs to $E(G)$
        \item we can obtain subgraphs by deleting edges and vertices.
        \item $G-F$
    \end{itemize}
\end{center}

By the way, $G \backslash e$ is the subgraph of G obtained by deleting the edge e 
and $G \backslash v$ is the subgraph of G obtained by deleting the vertex v and all edges incident with it.

    \colorbox{mygrey}{\color{myred}The complement of a simple graph}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{complement} $\overline{G}$ is the simple graph with the same vertex-set as G and with two vertices adjacent in $\overline{G}$ if and only if they are not adjacent in G.
    \end{itemize}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \colorbox{mygrey}{\color{myred}Matrix representation of graphs}
~\\
There are two matrix representations of graphs, the \textbf{adjacency matrix} and the \textbf{incidence matrix}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{adjacency matrix} $A(G)$ is the $n \times n$ matrix whose $(i,j)$-entry is 1 if $v_i$ is adjacent to $v_j$ and is 0 otherwise.
        \item \textbf{incidence matrix} $B(G)$ is the $n \times m$ matrix whose $(i,j)$-entry is 1 if $v_i$ is incident with $e_j$ and is 0 otherwise.
    \end{itemize}
\end{center}

\subsection{Examples}

\subsubsection{Null graphs}
A graph whose edge-set is empty is called a \textbf{null graph} 
and is denoted by $N_n$ or simply $N$ if the number of vertices is clear from the context.

\subsubsection{Complete graphs}
A graph with $n$ vertices in which each pair of distinct vertices is joined by an edge is 
called a \textbf{complete graph} and is denoted by $K_n$ or simply $K$ if the number of vertices 
is clear from the context. You can check that $K_n$ has $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges.

\subsubsection{Cycle graphs, path graphs and wheels}
A \textbf{connected graph} in which each vertex has degree 2 is called a \textbf{cycle graph} 
and is denoted by $C_n$ or simply $C$ if the number of vertices is clear from the context.
You can check that $C_n$ has $n$ vertices and $n$ edges.
\par
A graph obtained from $C_n$ by removing an edge is the \textbf{path graph} $P_n$ or 
simply $P$ if the number of vertices is clear from the context.
\par
The gragh obtained from $C_{n-1}$ by joining each vertex to a new vertex v is the $wheel$,denoted by $W_n$ or simply $W$ if the number of vertices is clear from the context.

\subsubsection{Regular graphs}
A graph is \textbf{regular} if each of its vertices has the same degree. 
If each vertex has degree $r$, the graph is said to be \textbf{r-regular}. 
A \textbf{complete graph} is $r-regular$ for $r=n-1$.
Note that \textbf{cubic graphs} are $3-regular$ graphs, and \textbf{null graphs} are $0-regular$ graphs.

\subsubsection{Platonic graphs}
A \textbf{Platonic graph} is a \textbf{regular} graph with the property that the number of vertices

    \caption{Platonic graphs}
    \label{fig:platonic}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Bipartite graphs}
If the vertex-set of G can be split into two disjoint sets $X$ and $Y$ 
such that each edge of G joins a vertex in $X$ to a vertex in $Y$, 
then G is said to be \textbf{bipartite}.
\par
A \textbf{complete bipartite graph} is a bipartite graph in which every vertex in $X$ is adjacent to every vertex in $Y$ and is denoted by $K_{X,Y}$.

\subsection{Cubes}
The \textbf{cube} $Q_n$ is the graph whose vertices are the $2^n$ binary strings of length $n$





\section{Paths and cycles}
\subsection{Connectivity}
\begin{center}
    \colorbox{mygrey}{\color{myred}Walks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{walk} in a graph G is a sequence of vertices $v_0,v_1,...,v_n$ such that $v_iv_{i+1}$ is an edge of G for $i=0,1,...,n-1$.
        \item We call $V_0$ the \textbf{initial vertex} and $v_n$ the \textbf{terminal vertex} of the walk.
        \item A \textbf{length} of a walk is the number of edges in it.
        \item A \textbf{closed walk} is a walk in which $v_0=v_n$.
        \item A \textbf{trail} is a walk in which all \textcolor{myred}{edges} are distinct.
        \item A \textbf{path} is a trail in which all \textcolor{myred}{vertices} are distinct.
        \item A \textbf{cycle} is a closed trail in which all vertices are distinct except for $v_0=v_n$.
        \subitem $\circ$ A \textbf{triangle} is a cycle of length 3.
    \end{itemize}

\end{center}

\begin{quote}
    A graph G is bipartite if and only if every cycle of G has even length.
