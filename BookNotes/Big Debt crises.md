# The  Big  Debt  Crises

# Part 1 

### How  I  think about credit and debt

***Definition***

* **Credit** is  the power of buying. The buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back.
* **Debt** is a promise to pay it back.

The question of whether rapid credit/debt growth is a good or bad thing hinges on whether the borrowed money is used productively enough to generate sufficient income to service the debt.  

Too little credit/debt  growth can create as bad or worse economic problems as having too much, with the costs coming in the form of foregone opportunities.

### How costly is bad debt relative to not having the spending that the debt financing?

By spreading out the cost, the costs would be rolerable.

Whether policy makers can do this depends on the two factors:

*  Whether the debt is denominated in the currency that they control
* whether they have influence over how creditors and debtors behave with each other.

### Are Debt Crises inevitable?

Yes.      Because the trend that through credit to get faster growth.

### Why do Debt Crises Come in Cycles ?

If you borrow money, it means that you should pay for it in the future.

Borrowing money sets a mechanical, predictable series of events into motion.

Lending naturally creates self-reinforcing upward movements that eventually reverse to create self-reinforcing downward  movement that must reverse in turn.

This type of cycle—where a strong growth upswing driven by debt-financed real estate, fixed investment, and infrastructure spending is followed by a downswing driven by a debt-challenged slowdown in demand—is very typical of emerging economies because they have so much building to do.

One classic warning **sign** that a bubble is coming is when an increasing amount of money is being borrowed to make debt service payments, which of course compounds the borrowers' indebtedness.

The two main long-term problems :

* The losses arising from the expected debt service payments not being made.
* The reduction of lending and the spending it was financing going forward.



### Can most Debt Crises Be Managed so There Aren't Big  Problems?

* when debts are denominated in foreign currencies rather than one’s own currency, it is much harder for a country’s policy makers to do the sorts of things that spread out the debt problems
*  the fact that debt crises can be well-managed does not mean that they are not extremely costly to some people.



The key to handling debt crises well lies in policy makers’ knowing how to use their levers well and having the authority that they need to do so. Four types of levers:

1. Austerity
2. Debt default/restructurings
3. The central bank"printing money" and making purchases
4. Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less
