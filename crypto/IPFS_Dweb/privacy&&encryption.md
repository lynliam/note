# Privacy and encryption

### the reason why IPFS doesn't contain the ***privacy layer***  build-in?

Freeing those building on IPFS to use the best privacy approach for the  situation at hand ensures IPFS is useful to as many as possible.



## What is public ?

All traffic on IPFS is public, including the contents of files themselves,.

### Content identifiers

Because of this, it's possible that third parties could be monitoring this traffic to determine what CIDs are being requested, when, and by  whom. As IPFS continues to grow in popularity, it's more likely that  such monitoring .

### Node identifiability

Keep in mind that it's possible to do a DHT lookup on your PeerID and,  particularly if your node is regularly running from the same location  (like your home), find your IP address.
