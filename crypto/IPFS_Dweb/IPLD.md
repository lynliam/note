# Interplanetary Linked Data (IPLD) [project](https://ipld.io/docs/)

**A data model for interoperable(互通) protocols.**

IPLD translates between hash-linked data structures, allowing for the unification of the data across distributed systems. Through IPLD, links can be traversed across protocols, allowing you to explore data regardless of the underlying protocol.

IPLD provides libraries for combining pluggable modules (parsers for  each possible type of IPLD node) to resolve a path, selector, or query  across many linked nodes, allowing you to explore data regardless of the underlying protocol.
